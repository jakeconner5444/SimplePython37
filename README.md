Run simple python application on windows XP to 11!

(Linux also supported)

For cross-platform apps, we changed all the clear command to `clean`. This way the software will convert clean into  the command that is used to clean console on your OS

Such as clear for linux, and cls for windows

To run a python script:
1. Write some code
  For example:
  print("hello")
3. Open command prompt for run menu or anywhere else
4. Run this command:
  "path/to/where/simplepython/is/installed/simplepython.exe" -r "path/to/your/python/script"
And you'll get your output, The example code output will be 'hello'

SimplePython3 can also run tkinter/turtle apps but it cannot use external libaries YET
